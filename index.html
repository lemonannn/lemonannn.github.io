<a href="https://richip7.itch.io/metroid">I helped recreate the first level of Metroid (NES). Here it be.</a>
I created about half of this. Worked on the base movement and level progression, a couple enemies, and contriubted heavily towards the creation of the custom level. Created with C# in Unity.

<a href="https://lemonan.itch.io/theblocksmove">The Blocks Move. They really do... trust me.</a>
All created by me myself and me again. Had support in playtesting from my boys. Also created using C# in Unity.

<a href="https://rafesymonds.itch.io/drawn-together-pulled-apart">Drawn Together, Pulled Apart. The best game about magnets you've ever played (I'm assuming that's a low bar).</a>
Worked in a group of five to create this in sixish weeks. Worked on UI elements, level design, and figuring out ways the magnets can interact with the levels.  Still created using C# in Unity.
